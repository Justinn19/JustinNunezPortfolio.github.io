Senior Year Project 2022-2023

Welcome to my portfolio, my name is Justin Nunez. I'm interested in web, app design, and other coding projects that could involve using Python. I'm currently learning about JQuery and Javascript. I'm looking to collaborate on several projects that will increases and test my knowledge on HTML, CSS, JQuery, Javascript, and Python. I'm confident about my ability to grow and thrive in this industry.
